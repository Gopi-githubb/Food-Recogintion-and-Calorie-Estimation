# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation using AI and Image Processing

## Abstract
This project explores the use of artificial intelligence and image processing to classify food items and estimate their calorie content. It leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to perform image classification, and incorporates a nutritional database to provide accurate calorie estimation based on portion size. This system can assist individuals in tracking their food intake, contributing to healthier lifestyle choices.

## Description
This project uses artificial intelligence and image processing to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify food and uses a nutritional database to calculate approximate calorie values. The system aims to help users easily track their food intake for better health management.

## Features
- Automated food recognition from images.
- Estimation of calories based on portion sizes.
- Supports various food categories (fruits, vegetables, fast food, etc.).
- Integration with a nutritional database for calorie estimation.
- Real-time recognition of food items via a camera feed.
- User interface for uploading images and displaying recognition results.
- Portion size estimation based on image scaling.
- Can be extended to mobile applications for on-the-go recognition and calorie tracking.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gopi-githubb/Food-Recogintion-and-Calorie-Estimation.git
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Food-Recogintion-and-Calorie-Estimation  	
4.	Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project as follows:
1.	To recognize food from an image:
   python food_recognition.py --image path_to_image
2.	To estimate calories from the recognized food:
   python calorie_estimation.py --image path_to_image

## Dataset
This project uses the Food-101 dataset which contains 101 categories of food with 1000 images per category. Preprocessing includes resizing images to 224x224 pixels and augmenting them for better model generalization.
Model Training..
The food recognition model is based on the ResNet-50 architecture, trained on the Food-101 dataset with the following settings:
-	Learning rate: 0.001
-	Batch size: 32
-	Epochs: 25
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test dataset. Example of an input and output:

-	Input: Image of a pizza
-	Output: Pizza, 285 calories per slice
