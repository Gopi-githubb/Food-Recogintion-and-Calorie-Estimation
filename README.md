# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation using AI and Image Processing

## Abstract
This project explores the use of artificial intelligence and image processing to classify food items and estimate their calorie content. It leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to perform image classification, and incorporates a nutritional database to provide accurate calorie estimation based on portion size. This system can assist individuals in tracking their food intake, contributing to healthier lifestyle choices.

## Description
This project uses artificial intelligence and image processing to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify food and uses a nutritional database to calculate approximate calorie values. The system aims to help users easily track their food intake for better health management.

## Features
- Automated food recognition from images.
- Estimation of calories based on portion sizes.
- Supports various food categories (fruits, vegetables, fast food, etc.).
- Integration with a nutritional database for calorie estimation.
- Real-time recognition of food items via a camera feed.
- User interface for uploading images and displaying recognition results.
- Portion size estimation based on image scaling.
- Can be extended to mobile applications for on-the-go recognition and calorie tracking.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
